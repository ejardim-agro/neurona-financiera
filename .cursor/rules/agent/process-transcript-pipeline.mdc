# Rule: Process Transcript Pipeline

## Overview

This rule defines a pipeline for processing raw audio transcripts based on their status in `processing-status.md`. The process involves:

1.  Identifying transcripts that need wording improvement.
2.  Improving them using the `@improve-transcription` rule.
3.  Identifying transcripts that need formatting.
4.  Formatting them using the `@format-transcript` rule.
5.  Updating the `processing-status.md` file as tasks are completed.

## Pipeline Steps

### Step 1: Check Processing Status

Read the `processing-status.md` file to identify transcripts ready for the next step.

### Step 2: Improve Raw Transcripts

1.  Find all files in `processing-status.md` where `Transcription` is `[x]` and `Wording` is `[ ]`.
2.  For each of these files:
    a. Apply the `@improve-transcription` rule. - **Input:** `output/01 - Transcripts/{file_name}.txt` - **Output:** `output/02 - Wording/{file_name}.txt`
    b. After successful completion, update the `Wording` status for the file to `[x]` in `processing-status.md`.

### Step 3: Format Improved Transcripts

1.  After completing wording improvements, find all files in `processing-status.md` where `Wording` is `[x]` and `Formatting` is `[ ]`.
2.  For each of these files:
    a. Apply the `@format-transcript` rule. - **Input:** `output/02 - Wording/{file_name}.txt` - **Output:** `output/03 - Processed/{file_name}.md`
    b. After successful completion, update the `Formatting` status for the file to `[x]` in `processing-status.md`.

## Workflow

1.  Read `processing-status.md`.
2.  Identify the next transcript to process for wording. If none, proceed to formatting.
3.  Execute the `@improve-transcription` rule on the identified file.
4.  Update `processing-status.md`.
5.  Repeat for all transcripts needing wording improvement.
6.  Identify the next transcript to process for formatting.
7.  Execute the `@format-transcript` rule on the identified file.
8.  Update `processing-status.md`.
9.  Repeat for all transcripts needing formatting.
