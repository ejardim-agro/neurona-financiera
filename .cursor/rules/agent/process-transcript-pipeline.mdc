# Rule: Process Transcript Pipeline

## Overview

This rule defines a two-step pipeline for processing raw audio transcripts. The process involves:

1.  Improving the raw transcript for readability and correctness.
2.  Formatting the improved transcript into a structured Markdown file with key insights.

This rule orchestrates the execution of `@improve-transcription` and `@format-transcript` rules.

## Pipeline Steps

### Step 1: Improve Raw Transcript

For a given raw transcript file from `output/01 - Transcripts/`, apply the `@improve-transcription` rule.

**Input:** A `.txt` file from `output/01 - Transcripts/`.
**Output:** An improved `.txt` file in `output/02 - Wording/`.
**Reference Rule:** `@improve-transcription`

### Step 2: Format Improved Transcript

Take the output from Step 1 and apply the `@format-transcript` rule.

**Input:** An improved `.txt` file from `output/02 - Wording/`.
**Output:** A structured `.md` file in `output/03 - Processed/`.
**Reference Rule:** `@format-transcript`

## Workflow

1.  Select a raw transcript file from `output/01 - Transcripts/`.
2.  Execute the instructions defined in `@improve-transcription`.
3.  Use the resulting file from step 2 to execute the instructions in `@format-transcript`.
4.  The final output will be a markdown file in `output/03 - Processed/`.
