# Rule: Improve Transcription

## Overview

This rule defines the process for taking a raw, auto-generated transcript and improving its quality. The goal is to correct transcription errors, fix punctuation, and enhance overall readability before further processing.

## Guidelines

1.  **Read the Original Transcript**: Open a `.txt` file from the `output/transcripts/` directory.
2.  **Identify and Correct Errors**:
    - **Punctuation**: Add missing commas, periods, and question marks to form coherent sentences.
    - **Capitalization**: Ensure proper capitalization at the beginning of sentences and for proper nouns.
    - **Filler Words**: Remove common filler words (`uh`, `um`, `like`, `you know`) unless they are essential to the meaning.
    - **Repeated Words**: Correct instances where words or phrases are repeated accidentally.
    - **Misspelled Words**: Correct any obvious spelling mistakes from the transcription.
3.  **Paragraphs**: Structure the text into logical paragraphs to improve readability. A new paragraph should start when the speaker changes topic.
4.  **Save the Improved Text**: Save the corrected text to a new file with the same name in the `output/02 - Wording/` directory.
